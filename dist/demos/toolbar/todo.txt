Important: fix cutting off the bottom of the content, or scrolling the toolbar off screen if overflow of the parent is set to scroll/auto
Implement content-speed-factor (padding is way to jerky)
    - maybe instead of translating the content we add padding to it originally then translate it to give it the effect
        of scrolling at a certain speed compared to the toolbar
fix picture display on desktop
    -What should it be? there's no "good" way to display the full picture
Implement expanded-keep
Let fade-stop continue beyond the scroll amount of toolbar
    - for example value of -50 would allow toolbar to fade for ANIMATE_AMOUNT + 50
Make sure content is overlapping toolbar correctly
    - toolbar goes behind content when expanded?
        - what about a toolbar fab that overlaps the content and the toolbar, this wont generally be done but may be
add a secondary tools element (for tabs search etc)

Maybe flexible space should be an entirely different element that can be "beneath" the toolbar and the content and
the toolbar and content can be transparent to show it or not. Then the flexible space can control how big it is,
the content can change the padding depending on how much flexible space should show and the toolbar can still have the
fade and shrink components.
